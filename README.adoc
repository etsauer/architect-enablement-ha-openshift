= HA/DR Architect Enablement

== Our Story (Current & Future)

The Entire OpenShift and Kubernetes space is trending towards a world where we treat clusters as cattle. To that, we need to be training our customers to build towards production solutions that involve multiple clusters, and the ability to easily fail over between them.

* Multiple clusters
  ** Fully automated using Infrastructure as Code (i.e. CASL, OpenShift Applier, OpenShift Ansible)
  ** Pipelines responsible for keeping workloads deployed to all clusters
* Load balanced locally with an Local Traffic Managers (Reverse Proxy)
* Load balanced Globally through Global Traffic Managers (DNS)
* Externalized state & storage
  ** CRS
  ** Cloud Provider Native storage
* Roadmap

== Managing Multiple Clusters

=== CASL Becoming More Consultant Friendly

* https://github.com/redhat-cop/casl-ansible/pull/237
* https://github.com/etsauer/casl-ansible/tree/docs-host-prep

Also, Infra-Ansible can be used to manage things around OpenShift, including standing HAProxy, DNS Infrastructure, Satellite, and more...
* https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra-ansible/blob/master/playbooks/lb-vms.yml
* https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra-ansible/blob/master/playbooks/provision-dns-server/main.yml
* https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra-ansible/blob/master/playbooks/provision-satellite-server/main.yml

=== Use Applier to manage cluster states

* https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-applier
* http://v1.uncontained.io/playbooks/fundamentals/template_development_guide.html

=== Use Pipelines to Deploy Workloads Everywhere

* https://github.com/redhat-cop/container-pipelines/tree/master/multi-cluster-spring-boot

Whiteboarding Session & Open Discussion

== Roadmap Discussion

Will discuss some product features that are coming that may help with this story.

== What we need to do

- Research & Develop Smarter Global Load Balancing Strategies
- A reference implementation of CNS & CRS architectures
