= HA/DR Architect Enablement

== Our Story

The Entire OpenShift and Kubernetes space is trending towards a world where we treat clusters as cattle. To that, we need to be training our customers to build towards production solutions that involve multiple clusters, and the ability to easily fail over between them.

* Multiple clusters
  ** Fully automated using Infrastructure as Code (CASL, OpenShift Applier)
* Load balanced locally with an Local Traffic Managers (Reverse Proxy)
* Load balanced Globally through Global Traffic Managers (DNS)
* Externalized state & storage
  ** CRS
  ** Cloud Provider Native storage
* Roadmap
